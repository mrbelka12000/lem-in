# Lem-in

The objective of this project is to navigate 'ants' through 'farm' with as few moves as possible (i.e. maximum flow problem)

### The project

A 'farm' consists of 'rooms' where only one ant can be at a time, and undirected unweighted 'tubes' between them

Two verteces marked as 'start' where all ants are, and 'end' where all ants should be

The program was tested to solve graphs with up to ten thousand verteces and dozens of possible superpositioned paths
